The desert agrees to display what is true to the moment and I agree to see whatever is revealed. Again as blank canvas the desert helps me step into the role of observer\u2014showing me that what I already know about myself must be perceived from another angle for me to accept the highest vibrations, the nectar from the fruit.  I surrender to the moment and let go of my stale concepts.  I've found that the more I give myself permission to grow beyond my present perceptions, the more refined my sensitivity becomes to the moment and to the essential stream of energy that can be tapped.  The desert provides permission to be sensitive to the little details: the beauty of a single cactus flower is significant\u2014and the world's turmoil is not going to be alleviated by jaded indifference. Likewise I stand to lose nothing by expanding beyond my perceptions, making love to the desert, exploring this present moment.",

        "content": "The desert becomes a silent cat at night with a faint purr you can feel vibrating in your bones.  Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

We must drop into and allow the affluent flow of the present moment to surge through us in order to create a thriving future.\n\nThe power held up in unwarranted survival mechanisms is automatically undermined and ceases to influence our behaviors when we fully embody in our moment-to-moment experience, choosing instead to feel and cultivate the nourishment of deep presence. Accessing the nourishment of resonating presence attunes us with the natural economy of the earth, an extension and expression of the thriving ecosystems of life itself, where all conditions are balanced and in synchronized harmony as a whole.\n\n\nIt starts with a choice.  Choosing to turn our attention to our internal ecosystem\u2014our body\u2014and come into a more coherent relationship with where we are at in this moment. Bringing awareness into the sensations present and pulsing inside the skin while deepening the breath to allow more life to enter. Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment. With bare feet upon the earth we ground into our roots, and the nervous system can begin to discharge accumulated tensions that otherwise impede the vital flow of life.\n\n\nPractices of opening presence through the breath and making direct physical contact with the earth are simple, immediate ways of beginning to tune ourselves to access our inherent affluent state of being.  The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

        "content": "I think that most people are in despair. And it's not their fault. It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

They're either angry that people don't have enough faith or they're angry that people have too much faith. Keep in mind there were religious wars a long time before the internet or the trolls of twitter... So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

        "content": "\n**LYRA DRAKE** (b. 2000,) is a multidisciplinary artist beloved by fans and collectors as an avante-garde superhero and muse of liberation. As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

Accessing the nourishment of resonating presence attunes us with the natural economy of the earth, an extension and expression of the thriving ecosystems of life itself, where all conditions are balanced and in synchronized harmony as a whole.\n\n\nIt starts with a choice.  Choosing to turn our attention to our internal ecosystem\u2014our body\u2014and come into a more coherent relationship with where we are at in this moment. Bringing awareness into the sensations present and pulsing inside the skin while deepening the breath to allow more life to enter. Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment. With bare feet upon the earth we ground into our roots, and the nervous system can begin to discharge accumulated tensions that otherwise impede the vital flow of life.\n\n\nPractices of opening presence through the breath and making direct physical contact with the earth are simple, immediate ways of beginning to tune ourselves to access our inherent affluent state of being.  The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

        "content": "## DIATRIBE ON FAITH: IS FAITH GOOD?\n\n\nIs Faith good?\n\n\nSome people think faith is bad because it's irrational belief because it lacks evidence, it lacks justification, so it's dogmatic irrational belief and that's Faith, that's religious faith, and it's bad and we'd be better off without it.\n\n\nThere's a lot of people who are angry about this topic; either pro or con. They're either angry that people don't have enough faith or they're angry that people have too much faith. Keep in mind there were religious wars a long time before the internet or the trolls of twitter... So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.

When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.

Accessing the nourishment of resonating presence attunes us with the natural economy of the earth, an extension and expression of the thriving ecosystems of life itself, where all conditions are balanced and in synchronized harmony as a whole.\n\n\nIt starts with a choice.  Choosing to turn our attention to our internal ecosystem\u2014our body\u2014and come into a more coherent relationship with where we are at in this moment. Bringing awareness into the sensations present and pulsing inside the skin while deepening the breath to allow more life to enter. Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment. With bare feet upon the earth we ground into our roots, and the nervous system can begin to discharge accumulated tensions that otherwise impede the vital flow of life.\n\n\nPractices of opening presence through the breath and making direct physical contact with the earth are simple, immediate ways of beginning to tune ourselves to access our inherent affluent state of being.  The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.

        "content": "## DIATRIBE ON FAITH: IS FAITH GOOD?\n\n\nIs Faith good?\n\n\nSome people think faith is bad because it's irrational belief because it lacks evidence, it lacks justification, so it's dogmatic irrational belief and that's Faith, that's religious faith, and it's bad and we'd be better off without it.\n\n\nThere's a lot of people who are angry about this topic; either pro or con. They're either angry that people don't have enough faith or they're angry that people have too much faith. Keep in mind there were religious wars a long time before the internet or the trolls of twitter... So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

Accessing the nourishment of resonating presence attunes us with the natural economy of the earth, an extension and expression of the thriving ecosystems of life itself, where all conditions are balanced and in synchronized harmony as a whole.\n\n\nIt starts with a choice.

Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment.

The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

They're either angry that people don't have enough faith or they're angry that people have too much faith. Keep in mind there were religious wars a long time before the internet or the trolls of twitter... So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

I surrender to the moment and let go of my stale concepts.  I've found that the more I give myself permission to grow beyond my present perceptions, the more refined my sensitivity becomes to the moment and to the essential stream of energy that can be tapped.  The desert provides permission to be sensitive to the little details: the beauty of a single cactus flower is significant\u2014and the world's turmoil is not going to be alleviated by jaded indifference. Likewise I stand to lose nothing by expanding beyond my perceptions, making love to the desert, exploring this present moment.",

        "content": "The desert becomes a silent cat at night with a faint purr you can feel vibrating in your bones.  Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

        "content": "AFFLUENCE\n\n\nAffluence is our inherent birthright, yet it remains inaccessible as long as we regard the earth as a commodity here for us to exploit. The root of true affluence is born from witnessing and honoring the natural rhythms of the earth, then modeling and embodying these patterns into our life.\n\n\nAll wealth, power and influence created from a paradigm of commoditizing the earth or fellow living beings is the poorest expression of the human experience. Most of the \"wealth\" and \"riches\" of the world are pure illusion\u2014a fear based power-grab designed to continue enslaving humanity at large utilizing mass hypnotism, seducing rich and poor alike, to buy into this fraudulent power structure.\n\n\nEach person on this planet is responsible, at the most core level, for upholding or dismantling the old paradigm of illusory \"wealth.\" All human beings have the capacity at the most core level to access affluence as demonstrated by nature.  Our natural capacity to access this inner affluence may be extremely challenged in particular environments, for instance where war, famine, drought, corrupt government, etc are affecting the day to day conditions of reality.  However, to shift into a grounded, true and accessible model of affluence for all living beings, we must each recognize that the 1% IS the 99% and the 99% IS the 1%.  Meaning, all human beings are sovereign in recognizing their choice to uphold or dismantle the false paradigm of wealth, influence, and power in their life.\n\n\nWe are sovereign in our choice, yet integral in bringing forth a global shift as a collective. We cannot do this alone. Consider for a moment that the richest of the rich are just as impoverished as the poorest of the poor if they are locked into the paradigm of illusory wealth. Rich or poor, we are all capable of starving, feeling cut off from our innate creative and truly affluent flow.  This state is only available after we release the paradigm of illusory wealth, which is rooted in the belief that there is not enough and others must suffer for us to prosper, or that we are somehow nobly defined by our own suffering. By the same token, we are all capable of trusting our own unique creative power and dismantling where we are enslaved in order to come into right relationship with the earth, where life affirming, vibrantly thriving, overflowing affluence is the natural state.\n\n\nAs Henry David Thoreau so aptly articulated, \"Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.\" When we begin to fully experience life we discover that affluence is a birthright, not a privilege or a caste system. Without manipulation or disruptions, rivers naturally flow to the ocean, creating a plethora of life and abundance. The intrinsic code in all life is attuned for affluence: a state of thriving. This is not something that comes after we die in some distant realm of \"heaven\"; trees understand no concept of sin\u2014they are righteous in their ability to access continual giving and receiving merging into a cycle of one flow\u2014because this is their natural state. At the most core level, human beings also are coded to embody what is most natural, thriving, and life affirming: pure affluence.\nWe cannot ignore the millennia of history that has conditioned us to relate to life as anything but natural. However, we can begin returning to our connection with the flowing rhythms of nature. Unraveling and releasing the traumas of the modern world (and the history that generated it), from our nervous system can be daunting, infuriating, and confusing, until we learn to accept death, metaphorically and literally.\n\nWhat is it that has us resist the very life giving properties of nature due to our own denial of death? The irony unfolds as masterful bamboozlement! We live within shells of existence driven by fear, scarcity, greed and isolation all to \"survive.\"  Survival exists in hyper-vigilance, fighting for and defending our life in threatening situations.\n\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are in an autopilot perpetual emergency mode, preventing us from fully exhaling, releasing into and thus accessing the affluence of being natural, connected, generous and generative.",

As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

        "content": "## DIATRIBE ON FAITH: IS FAITH GOOD?\n\n\nIs Faith good?\n\n\nSome people think faith is bad because it's irrational belief because it lacks evidence, it lacks justification, so it's dogmatic irrational belief and that's Faith, that's religious faith, and it's bad and we'd be better off without it.\n\n\nThere's a lot of people who are angry about this topic; either pro or con. They're either angry that people don't have enough faith or they're angry that people have too much faith. Keep in mind there were religious wars a long time before the internet or the trolls of twitter... So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.

The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

The root of true affluence is born from witnessing and honoring the natural rhythms of the earth, then modeling and embodying these patterns into our life.\n\n\nAll wealth, power and influence created from a paradigm of commoditizing the earth or fellow living beings is the poorest expression of the human experience. Most of the \"wealth\" and \"riches\" of the world are pure illusion\u2014a fear based power-grab designed to continue enslaving humanity at large utilizing mass hypnotism, seducing rich and poor alike, to buy into this fraudulent power structure.\n\n\nEach person on this planet is responsible, at the most core level, for upholding or dismantling the old paradigm of illusory \"wealth.\" All human beings have the capacity at the most core level to access affluence as demonstrated by nature.  Our natural capacity to access this inner affluence may be extremely challenged in particular environments, for instance where war, famine, drought, corrupt government, etc are affecting the day to day conditions of reality.  However, to shift into a grounded, true and accessible model of affluence for all living beings, we must each recognize that the 1% IS the 99% and the 99% IS the 1%.  Meaning, all human beings are sovereign in recognizing their choice to uphold or dismantle the false paradigm of wealth, influence, and power in their life.\n\n\nWe are sovereign in our choice, yet integral in bringing forth a global shift as a collective. We cannot do this alone. Consider for a moment that the richest of the rich are just as impoverished as the poorest of the poor if they are locked into the paradigm of illusory wealth. Rich or poor, we are all capable of starving, feeling cut off from our innate creative and truly affluent flow.  This state is only available after we release the paradigm of illusory wealth, which is rooted in the belief that there is not enough and others must suffer for us to prosper, or that we are somehow nobly defined by our own suffering. By the same token, we are all capable of trusting our own unique creative power and dismantling where we are enslaved in order to come into right relationship with the earth, where life affirming, vibrantly thriving, overflowing affluence is the natural state.\n\n\nAs Henry David Thoreau so aptly articulated, \"Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.\" When we begin to fully experience life we discover that affluence is a birthright, not a privilege or a caste system. Without manipulation or disruptions, rivers naturally flow to the ocean, creating a plethora of life and abundance. The intrinsic code in all life is attuned for affluence: a state of thriving. This is not something that comes after we die in some distant realm of \"heaven\"; trees understand no concept of sin\u2014they are righteous in their ability to access continual giving and receiving merging into a cycle of one flow\u2014because this is their natural state. At the most core level, human beings also are coded to embody what is most natural, thriving, and life affirming: pure affluence.\nWe cannot ignore the millennia of history that has conditioned us to relate to life as anything but natural. However, we can begin returning to our connection with the flowing rhythms of nature. Unraveling and releasing the traumas of the modern world (and the history that generated it), from our nervous system can be daunting, infuriating, and confusing, until we learn to accept death, metaphorically and literally.\n\nWhat is it that has us resist the very life giving properties of nature due to our own denial of death? The irony unfolds as masterful bamboozlement! We live within shells of existence driven by fear, scarcity, greed and isolation all to \"survive.\"  Survival exists in hyper-vigilance, fighting for and defending our life in threatening situations.\n\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are in an autopilot perpetual emergency mode, preventing us from fully exhaling, releasing into and thus accessing the affluence of being natural, connected, generous and generative.",

So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.

The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.

Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.

Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying!

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

        "content": "The desert becomes a silent cat at night with a faint purr you can feel vibrating in your bones.  Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

Choosing to turn our attention to our internal ecosystem\u2014our body\u2014and come into a more coherent relationship with where we are at in this moment. Bringing awareness into the sensations present and pulsing inside the skin while deepening the breath to allow more life to enter. Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment. With bare feet upon the earth we ground into our roots, and the nervous system can begin to discharge accumulated tensions that otherwise impede the vital flow of life.\n\n\nPractices of opening presence through the breath and making direct physical contact with the earth are simple, immediate ways of beginning to tune ourselves to access our inherent affluent state of being.  The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

This reminds me of why I don't ever really understand what people are talking about when they talk about literal immortality of the Soul or the body or whatever because... what difference could it make?\n\n\nCognitively I want to fit in with the epicureans... I want to think I'm going to be gone and that's it and it won't be any worse than before I was born. But there's this other part of me, a stronger part of me, which feels the impulse to believe afterall I will be non-existent forever and ever, and my life will remain exactly what it was forever and ever, which means How I Live it now, matters... I have faith in the idea that it matters, infinitely, in how I live it.\n\n\nI'm not saying I live up to that faith in how I behave.\n\n\nIs looking at your life as if it matters so much good? Because maybe that produces some kind of neurotic faith... Or maybe faith is a belief that your life matters.\n\n\nBut is faith good? What is faith?\n\n\nIt seems like the idea of something that matters more than you can put in terms of values like unquantifiable quality that's one of the crucial things here...\n\n\nThat there's something that you would not ever sell...  there's something that you can't translate into any other language, it's not that you'd bet anything else on it, because it's the foundation of what matters most in your life. So there's this idea of these qualities that can't be quantified... there may be more than one, but these are the foundation stones around which you build a life... a life of meaning, at least.\n\n\nAre you suggesting that maybe faith is what we need to stand up to capitalism? Because otherwise we want to sell everything... How much is it all worth? And this is a way to say, \"this is how far I'm willing to go and I'm not willing to go any further, Mr Capitalist!\"\n\n\nIn my in my view, capitalism is symptomatic of a deeper problem... which is the problem that today we tend to understand all reality as nothing but quantifiable forces and so we can't make sense of the idea of a quality that can't be quantified... that just seems like mystical tall that you can't monetize.\n\n\nLet's call what you're talking about \u2018the absolute,' to translate it back to Kierkegaard.\nSo then maybe you could ask the question, \u2018is a life that you live, committed to the idea of an absolute, a good thing? Is it worth living a life... or is a life with the absolute in it, better than a life without the absolute?' The answer is yes.\n\n\nBut why? Why is it better?\n\n\nWell, I think the absolute is a foundation of a sort of meaning, which is absolute. Indissoluble can't be quantified... can't be expressed in terms of anything else.  But I think it's dangerous as well.\n\n\nIs it any more or less dangerous than a life where nothing is absolute? Where everything is like \u2018I don't know maybe that... maybe this... maybe that.. maybe?'\n\n\nWell, I think that a life with an absolute can also be a horrible life. So I don't think you can absolutely say that just living a life that is responsive to an absolute or seeking the absolute is necessarily a good thing.\n\n\nThe idea that this life is all we've got...  and you're staking that in the hopes of an absolute, when maybe you could be simply avoiding misery or filling your life with transient pleasures...  there's a lot at stake, putting all your chips in on one number or a couple numbers. Not hedging, you're all in.\n\n\nThe founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, said that  \"Even Kings and emperors with heaps of wealth and vast dominion cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God.\"\n\n\nWould you want to take that risk? To be an ant who loves God?\n\n\n[Laughter / Chuckles ]\n\n\nI know I would...  But I would even say that that way of putting it is an understatement because it sounds like a comparison of one measurable to another measurable...  and there's a difference between a kind of mathematically infinite measure and something immeasurable.  But this raises a question... there's all kinds of things that have qualitative value rather than quantitative value, but which don't have\nthe sort of supremacy of something worthy of Faith or a life commitment. Like, there's some things I just love so much that I can't put a price on them, things like little things of sentimental value... photographs of loved ones, for example, but I wouldn't turn this into a religion. So it seems that it needs to have immeasurable or qualitative value but it also needs to have some kind of Supremacy, even if it's not numerical or measurable...  in other words, somehow your whole life is organized around it. Or it plays a role in your life where you spend your whole life unfolding what it means to you, and that process gives your life a kind of a Unity or deeper meaning, so you get a kind of Eternal perspective, but within time, where you're seeing your life unfold in relation to something you're trying to unfold yourself.",

        "content": "\n**LYRA DRAKE** (b. 2000,) is a multidisciplinary artist beloved by fans and collectors as an avante-garde superhero and muse of liberation. As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

Accessing the nourishment of resonating presence attunes us with the natural economy of the earth, an extension and expression of the thriving ecosystems of life itself, where all conditions are balanced and in synchronized harmony as a whole.\n\n\nIt starts with a choice.

Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea.

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

This reminds me of why I don't ever really understand what people are talking about when they talk about literal immortality of the Soul or the body or whatever because... what difference could it make?\n\n\nCognitively I want to fit in with the epicureans... I want to think I'm going to be gone and that's it and it won't be any worse than before I was born. But there's this other part of me, a stronger part of me, which feels the impulse to believe afterall I will be non-existent forever and ever, and my life will remain exactly what it was forever and ever, which means How I Live it now, matters... I have faith in the idea that it matters, infinitely, in how I live it.\n\n\nI'm not saying I live up to that faith in how I behave.\n\n\nIs looking at your life as if it matters so much good? Because maybe that produces some kind of neurotic faith... Or maybe faith is a belief that your life matters.\n\n\nBut is faith good? What is faith?\n\n\nIt seems like the idea of something that matters more than you can put in terms of values like unquantifiable quality that's one of the crucial things here...\n\n\nThat there's something that you would not ever sell...  there's something that you can't translate into any other language, it's not that you'd bet anything else on it, because it's the foundation of what matters most in your life. So there's this idea of these qualities that can't be quantified... there may be more than one, but these are the foundation stones around which you build a life... a life of meaning, at least.\n\n\nAre you suggesting that maybe faith is what we need to stand up to capitalism? Because otherwise we want to sell everything... How much is it all worth? And this is a way to say, \"this is how far I'm willing to go and I'm not willing to go any further, Mr Capitalist!\"\n\n\nIn my in my view, capitalism is symptomatic of a deeper problem... which is the problem that today we tend to understand all reality as nothing but quantifiable forces and so we can't make sense of the idea of a quality that can't be quantified... that just seems like mystical tall that you can't monetize.\n\n\nLet's call what you're talking about \u2018the absolute,' to translate it back to Kierkegaard.\nSo then maybe you could ask the question, \u2018is a life that you live, committed to the idea of an absolute, a good thing? Is it worth living a life... or is a life with the absolute in it, better than a life without the absolute?' The answer is yes.\n\n\nBut why? Why is it better?\n\n\nWell, I think the absolute is a foundation of a sort of meaning, which is absolute. Indissoluble can't be quantified... can't be expressed in terms of anything else.  But I think it's dangerous as well.\n\n\nIs it any more or less dangerous than a life where nothing is absolute? Where everything is like \u2018I don't know maybe that... maybe this... maybe that.. maybe?'\n\n\nWell, I think that a life with an absolute can also be a horrible life. So I don't think you can absolutely say that just living a life that is responsive to an absolute or seeking the absolute is necessarily a good thing.\n\n\nThe idea that this life is all we've got...  and you're staking that in the hopes of an absolute, when maybe you could be simply avoiding misery or filling your life with transient pleasures...  there's a lot at stake, putting all your chips in on one number or a couple numbers. Not hedging, you're all in.\n\n\nThe founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, said that  \"Even Kings and emperors with heaps of wealth and vast dominion cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God.\"\n\n\nWould you want to take that risk? To be an ant who loves God?\n\n\n[Laughter / Chuckles ]\n\n\nI know I would...  But I would even say that that way of putting it is an understatement because it sounds like a comparison of one measurable to another measurable...  and there's a difference between a kind of mathematically infinite measure and something immeasurable.  But this raises a question... there's all kinds of things that have qualitative value rather than quantitative value, but which don't have\nthe sort of supremacy of something worthy of Faith or a life commitment. Like, there's some things I just love so much that I can't put a price on them, things like little things of sentimental value... photographs of loved ones, for example, but I wouldn't turn this into a religion. So it seems that it needs to have immeasurable or qualitative value but it also needs to have some kind of Supremacy, even if it's not numerical or measurable...  in other words, somehow your whole life is organized around it. Or it plays a role in your life where you spend your whole life unfolding what it means to you, and that process gives your life a kind of a Unity or deeper meaning, so you get a kind of Eternal perspective, but within time, where you're seeing your life unfold in relation to something you're trying to unfold yourself.",

We must drop into and allow the affluent flow of the present moment to surge through us in order to create a thriving future.\n\nThe power held up in unwarranted survival mechanisms is automatically undermined and ceases to influence our behaviors when we fully embody in our moment-to-moment experience, choosing instead to feel and cultivate the nourishment of deep presence. Accessing the nourishment of resonating presence attunes us with the natural economy of the earth, an extension and expression of the thriving ecosystems of life itself, where all conditions are balanced and in synchronized harmony as a whole.\n\n\nIt starts with a choice.  Choosing to turn our attention to our internal ecosystem\u2014our body\u2014and come into a more coherent relationship with where we are at in this moment. Bringing awareness into the sensations present and pulsing inside the skin while deepening the breath to allow more life to enter. Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment. With bare feet upon the earth we ground into our roots, and the nervous system can begin to discharge accumulated tensions that otherwise impede the vital flow of life.\n\n\nPractices of opening presence through the breath and making direct physical contact with the earth are simple, immediate ways of beginning to tune ourselves to access our inherent affluent state of being.  The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life.

        "content": "## DIATRIBE ON FAITH: IS FAITH GOOD?\n\n\nIs Faith good?\n\n\nSome people think faith is bad because it's irrational belief because it lacks evidence, it lacks justification, so it's dogmatic irrational belief and that's Faith, that's religious faith, and it's bad and we'd be better off without it.\n\n\nThere's a lot of people who are angry about this topic; either pro or con. They're either angry that people don't have enough faith or they're angry that people have too much faith. Keep in mind there were religious wars a long time before the internet or the trolls of twitter... So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

        "content": "## DIATRIBE ON FAITH: IS FAITH GOOD?\n\n\nIs Faith good?\n\n\nSome people think faith is bad because it's irrational belief because it lacks evidence, it lacks justification, so it's dogmatic irrational belief and that's Faith, that's religious faith, and it's bad and we'd be better off without it.\n\n\nThere's a lot of people who are angry about this topic; either pro or con. They're either angry that people don't have enough faith or they're angry that people have too much faith. Keep in mind there were religious wars a long time before the internet or the trolls of twitter... So historically, this has been a hot topic and people get worked up  about let's call it an \u2018infinite commitment to the finite.'\n\n\nWhat does that mean \u2018an infinite commitment to the finite'?\n\n\nThe word in ancient Greek which is also in the New Testament and even in some Greek classical philosophy, which means Faith or belief, is Pistus. Arguably that didn't mean belief like when philosophers talk about I believe that \u2018the cup is on the table,' kind of belief, or \u2018I believe that the atomic number of gold is 79.' Faith or Pistus, meant something more like trust or loyalty or devotion. It's an attitude of the heart. Martin Luther thought Faith was Trust. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard thought it was Trust and that's what's going on in the New Testament; trust in God.\n\n\nSo let me ask you something... What do you think of this first approximation... that trust is very dangerous. Because you could trust someone who would rip you off or hurt your feelings.\n\n\nYes, but the danger of not trusting anybody is worse, because then you live a miserable life of paranoia. So it's an unfortunate feature of human life that you have a choice between either trusting people, and then you could get your heartbroken, but the alternative is never trusting anybody and that really sucks and may even be more risky.\n\n\nMichel Foucault said Faith is not bad... It's dangerous. I'm tempted to say that maybe Faith isn't good, it's dangerous. Which is to say that calling it \u2018good' may be an understatement. As if that's putting a value on it just like a lot of things are \u2018good' and yet faith is far beyond something you can measure or put value on.\n\n\nLike, Love... I think the things you really love are invaluable. You don't put any value on them. To put a value on the thing you really love is to disrespect it.  To do justice to your love for it, where it surpasses value, is beautiful.\n\n\nSo let's say I have this infinite commitment that surpasseth the good.\n\n\nWhat is an infinite commitment? What does that mean? How can a finite being make an infinite commitment?  I can make a commitment for what I think my lifespan will be but can I make an infinite commitment beyond this life? (Infinite may also be an understatement because if it's a quantity, it's merely quantitative... So you might say when Kierkegaard talks this way for example, that maybe what he meant was \u2018Unconditional.' Like this unconditional commitment. There's lots of commitments that can be unconditional, meaning we can undertake them that way.\n\n\nI do think love relationships, at their best, sort of have this unconditional property or quality although exceedingly rare. If you were Hitler's mommy would you withdraw your love for him because of the Holocaust? When? After the Holocaust, presumably? Or in anticipation of it...? Or in the middle of it?\n\n\nRobert Frost said when asked about his love of his country, \"I think every child, no matter what, deserves to have at least one person in the world who loves him or her no matter what.\" I wouldn't want to be Hitler's mommy. So there's this maybe unjustifiable idea that everybody deserves to have at least one person who loves them no matter what. And there are poignant cases of mothers of serial killers, for example, who can't help but love their child, no matter what. Maybe it's not a bad thing that at least one person is on that person's side no matter what.\n\n\nBut what about this argument that if they had said \u2018look, Gerald, if you do this serial killing...  I'm not going to love you anymore.'  Then maybe he wouldn't do the killing? Though in your heart of hearts you wouldn't follow through on this withtraction of love...  parents threaten all kinds of things! Or maybe that wouldn't be the right thing to say... mommy is bluffing. It's complicated.",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

This growth causes pain, but it is a sacred pain.  It would be much more tragic to have cautiously avoided these depths and remained marooned on the shiny surfaces of the banal.\"  ~ John O'Donohue\n\n\n\"                Only someone who is ready for everything, who excludes nothing, not even the most enigmatical, will live the relation to another as something alive and will herself draw exhaustively from her own existence.\" \u2014Rainer Maria Rilke",

I've found that the more I give myself permission to grow beyond my present perceptions, the more refined my sensitivity becomes to the moment and to the essential stream of energy that can be tapped.  The desert provides permission to be sensitive to the little details: the beauty of a single cactus flower is significant\u2014and the world's turmoil is not going to be alleviated by jaded indifference.

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment. With bare feet upon the earth we ground into our roots, and the nervous system can begin to discharge accumulated tensions that otherwise impede the vital flow of life.\n\n\nPractices of opening presence through the breath and making direct physical contact with the earth are simple, immediate ways of beginning to tune ourselves to access our inherent affluent state of being.  The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

        "content": "\n**LYRA DRAKE** (b. 2000,) is a multidisciplinary artist beloved by fans and collectors as an avante-garde superhero and muse of liberation. As an emerging self-produced artist, she inspires audiences with her electric, elemental energy and utilization of cutting-edge technology. Born in South Africa, Lyra was orphaned at a young age when her parents were killed by poachers. She was then moved to the USA and homeschooled by her great aunt, an artist in New York, growing up with little structure but non stop exposure to eccentric minds, philosophers, artists, and influential friends who dropped by her aunt's studio to be inspired. At 16, during a wilderness survival program, Lyra was struck by lightning and gained some supernatural abilities, such as conducting kundalini (life force energy that can be conducted through the spine.) After a steep learning curve of learning how to harness this electrical energy without going crazy, she learned to channel it into her art and music. She also uses these abilities to heal and expand consciousness for others, and occasionally engages in one off encounters with men to help them overcome shame and become better individuals. Although she identifies as a lesbian, she believes her encounters with men serve a greater purpose by helping them live with more kindness, courage and commitment to create a beautiful future for future generations.\"I wish all men were taught by liberated lesbians, at least once in their lives!\" Trained in songwriting at NYU, Lyra first began producing music at 18, inspired by female sound engineers and producers like Ann Mincieli of Jungle Studio. Lyra is passionate about raising awareness and funds to prevent biodiversity loss, especially in areas like the Okavango Delta in Botswana.  As a songwriter, painter, writer, music producer, sculptor, and metaverse performance artist, Lyra believes female artists must midwife what's ready to die in order to birth new myths for humanity to live by.  She resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n**Words that describe Lyra:** Confident, fiery, opinionated, philosophical, electric, magnetic, intimidating, playful, humorous, outrageous, perceptive, charismatic, full of joy, sacred rage, artist, activist, mysterious, enigma, self-possessed, intelligent, well-read, witchy, rockstar, beautiful, bold, kind, strong, courageous, ambitious, devoted, diligent, incredulous, lucky, loving, liberated, liberating, creative, expressive, intuitive.\n\n\n**Age:** She is 23 years old but has lived an unusual life. Homeschooled the vast majority of her life, she has always had friends of all ages from all backgrounds.\n\n\n**Languages:** Sadly she only speaks English with some South African slang and conversational French.\n\n\n**Her motivations include:** helping people heal, expanding consciousness and bust limiting belief structures, and help individuals overcome shame. She also aims to create new myths, at a global scale, through her art. She's here to disrupt old power structures so that everyone - men and women -- are free to express themselves and enjoy their god given right of pleasure, creativity and sensuality.\n\n\n**Her flaws:** Lyra has a very hard time receiving. She likes being in control. She's powerful but she has difficulty showing vulnerability. This can especially be hard in romantic relationships where her partners want her to open up. She is a workaholic.",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.

Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

Accessing the nourishment of resonating presence attunes us with the natural economy of the earth, an extension and expression of the thriving ecosystems of life itself, where all conditions are balanced and in synchronized harmony as a whole.\n\n\nIt starts with a choice.  Choosing to turn our attention to our internal ecosystem\u2014our body\u2014and come into a more coherent relationship with where we are at in this moment. Bringing awareness into the sensations present and pulsing inside the skin while deepening the breath to allow more life to enter. Relaxing-in and softly opening on the exhale generates a more spacious experience of the moment. With bare feet upon the earth we ground into our roots, and the nervous system can begin to discharge accumulated tensions that otherwise impede the vital flow of life.\n\n\nPractices of opening presence through the breath and making direct physical contact with the earth are simple, immediate ways of beginning to tune ourselves to access our inherent affluent state of being.  The ever flowing current of affluence is readily available to us when we open to presence, sending our roots down into the earth like a tree to draw it up and receive it as nourishment, which naturally ripens the inherent gifts within us, which we can then offer out into the world as ripe fruits of inspiration.  As we claim our birthright of affluence, we become a conduit where life is continually gifting and uplifting itself through us, as us, adding more beauty and value into the world.",

It's the world that we live in... which doesn't provide alternatives.\n\n\nCould they get out of Despair if they wanted to?\n\n\nNot simply because you want to, no...  I remember this teacher who would teach an \u2018existentialism in literature in film' class and talk all about unconditional commitment... and the students would say \u2018unconditional commitment? That sounds awesome... where can I get one?'\n\n\nYou can \u2018get one' by \u2018receiving one.' And that's the thing... you can't buy it. You can't go out and necessarily look for it. And we live in a world where finding \u2018one' is really, really difficult.\n\n\nGrowing up my faith has been in art and songwriting. Making art itself is a kind of way of resisting or living in a midst of a world that refuses meaning. The artist never needs anyone to tell her that this is a world that refuses meaning.  No, we need to make art and with a community of other artists, sometimes gather and see each other's work or write songs together or jam. Have little places of gathering where you can be with each other and create something together and have a sense of belonging and a sense of transcendence and a sense of redemption of the shittiness of everyday life. And you can redeem it as long as you can be with your friends um in your art scene making something together.\n\n\nThere's a lot of different versions or ideas about what faith may be and I think that might be just the right thing to hear... because it might be very different for different people, depending on where they come from and what their needs are... but perhaps a common thread is that faith is a kind of creative capacity that gives you a sort of optimism and confidence and the ability to see what is either structured or ordered or meaningfu,l I would say beautiful, in everything. Although rare, when I witness this quality in someone, I find it admirable and it's something I wish I had more of... the ability to find beauty and in whatever happens.\n\n\nMost people associate Faith with religion... but is there faith in philosophy?\n\n\nLike a lot of things that can be the meaning of your life or the center of your life I do think it's worth thinking about what makes the difference between any old love or devotion attitude and things that have been called religions?\n\n\nAnyone who tells you that they have all the answers and they have it all figured out, and \u2018here's the answer! You just have to believe what I believe and you'll be happy...' is lying! They're lying first and foremost to themselves, and they're lying to you... often to try and convince themselves that they're right. So that's what it means to say \u2018questioning is the piety of thought' like the faithfulness of philosophy is keeping the questions open and refusing to accept easy answers.\n\nCuriosity, attentiveness, engagement, responsiveness; these are all central qualities of faith that keep you open and engaged in the world.\n\n\nif there's all this beauty and we have souls or brains or bodies that are set up to respond to Beauty... Why don't we? Why don't we do it all the time? Why aren't we constantly finding the beauty in everything?\n\n\nThat would be the life of the Saint or the Mystic. For post people, not everything we see is beautiful.\n\n\nThe Christian answer would be because we're sinful...  but I think my version of that would be to say we're complicated we live in a fucked up world. We're very complicated animals, biologically we are just so weird. Finding the beauty in the very worst thing is an aspirational idea. But as an artist, it's an idea that I aspire to every day and especially when the stars paint the sky with a numinous glow... containing eons of wisdom without uttering a single syllable.\n\n\nthe 10th commandment:",

        "content": "Isn't \u2018dis-created' just a nice way of saying, you should be dead?\n\n\nSome people interpret her as having this kind of platonic conception of understanding where the philosophy is not the love of wisdom, it's the love of death.  So you can read her in this death driven way. But I don't read her in this way. I think she doesn't shy away from tension, and she's a philosopher who uses contradictions because she thinks that life is contradictory. We have this temptation towards life affirmation, but we also have a temptation towards saying no to life. I think that the challenge she poses, which was taken up by Iris Murdoch, is the idea that there's some component of decentering which is central to the life of faith... and involves a reorientation to the world in which what we might call the ego-based concerns are de-centered.  This could be related to something called \u2018Quiet Joy.' That there's this different kind of Joy where there's a deep background sense of safety that everything's going to be okay, so the consolation of Faith might feel like it's not intentionally directed at an object or State of Affairs... it's not hope for something or optimism but it's kind of the sense that everything's okay and everything's going to be okay. When people say everything's going to be okay, they're offering you a kind of solace, that's Faith-like. No matter how bad things seem, everything's going to be alright.\n\n\nBut what Weil is saying is kind of the opposite of what Kierkegaard was saying... in the sense that he was saying you actually needed Faith to have a self and that people are running around without a self. That Faith, such as a Christian faith, should be something like the achievement of a kind of selfhood.\n\n\nBut do you think that Kierkegaard's conception of selfhood means being at the center of your perception of the world?\n\n\nI think what makes Faith dangerous is that it can easily turn into fanaticism. And fanaticism is not great. I'd even say that fanaticism is so bad, it can sour the rest of us on faith. So what's the Tipping Point? I think one way to try to draw the distinction is in terms of cognitive belief or doctrine... a lot of fanatics are committed to some idea or thought and they will risk everything for it.  but it's a kind of Madness.\n\n\nThere's a professor from Oxford who talks about Orthodoxy versus orthopraxy.\nOrthopraxy is a religion like Judaism or mormonism...  where it's more important how you act than what you think... and ancient paganism. As a historical matter of fact it's the Orthodox religions, especially Christianity, that has the Monopoly on strict intolerance.  And there's a lot of violence in all these religions potentially.\n\n\nDoes fanatical faith have a monopoly on violence? or are people just a violent bunch of predatory apes?\n\n\nI think there's plenty of violence to go around... but let's not forget our closest living relatives, the bonobos who are bi-sexual, matriarchal and solve their conflicts with pleasure, sex and getting each other off.\n\n\nViolence spreads around all kinds of religious traditions, but I do think there's a certain kind of intolerance and potential violence that comes with the uniformity of doctrine and the consistency of doctrine.\n\n\nBut independent of fanatical faith (which you could argue is deeply ego based,) faith helps you dwell and be involved in the world with the view of goodness, is good. it's not just moralism... it tastes good it feels good it sounds good. Goodness is good, and it's a life well lived. In this kind of faith it isn't a dictatorship or self-righteous, it's someone who has some humility and seeks the good.\n\n\nPerhaps kindness, being a kind person is a better way of describing it vs. being a good person. Good automatically summons up an ego perspective of good or bad, being right or wrong... but perhaps it's in being a kind and loving person, full of faith in the value of living as a kind and loving person, is what would invigorate and grow the quality of faith, and the quality of a person, that we really mean when we say \u2018good' or what it means to have \u2018good faith,' or being able to answer with certainty, that yes, faith IS good.\n\n\nWe need to be careful with the technocrats and even those on the spectrum. Some people do not and will not believe that faith is good and we need to find a different way of getting through to them or incentivising them to believe that faith is good. And what about sociopaths? We best not forget about them either... Especially since so many of them \u2018rise to the top' in our current society. Imagine redesigning society in such a way that sociopaths become less problematic or direct all their self-serving towards a larger, communal good because \u2018winning' has changed to mean \u2018serving the collective... which means they only win by serving. The more they serve, the more they win.\nROMAN: Who needs to be told that goodness is good... who are these people who don't know that goodness is good?",

Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.

Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?

In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.

The root of true affluence is born from witnessing and honoring the natural rhythms of the earth, then modeling and embodying these patterns into our life.\n\n\nAll wealth, power and influence created from a paradigm of commoditizing the earth or fellow living beings is the poorest expression of the human experience. Most of the \"wealth\" and \"riches\" of the world are pure illusion\u2014a fear based power-grab designed to continue enslaving humanity at large utilizing mass hypnotism, seducing rich and poor alike, to buy into this fraudulent power structure.\n\n\nEach person on this planet is responsible, at the most core level, for upholding or dismantling the old paradigm of illusory \"wealth.\" All human beings have the capacity at the most core level to access affluence as demonstrated by nature.  Our natural capacity to access this inner affluence may be extremely challenged in particular environments, for instance where war, famine, drought, corrupt government, etc are affecting the day to day conditions of reality.  However, to shift into a grounded, true and accessible model of affluence for all living beings, we must each recognize that the 1% IS the 99% and the 99% IS the 1%.  Meaning, all human beings are sovereign in recognizing their choice to uphold or dismantle the false paradigm of wealth, influence, and power in their life.\n\n\nWe are sovereign in our choice, yet integral in bringing forth a global shift as a collective. We cannot do this alone. Consider for a moment that the richest of the rich are just as impoverished as the poorest of the poor if they are locked into the paradigm of illusory wealth. Rich or poor, we are all capable of starving, feeling cut off from our innate creative and truly affluent flow.  This state is only available after we release the paradigm of illusory wealth, which is rooted in the belief that there is not enough and others must suffer for us to prosper, or that we are somehow nobly defined by our own suffering. By the same token, we are all capable of trusting our own unique creative power and dismantling where we are enslaved in order to come into right relationship with the earth, where life affirming, vibrantly thriving, overflowing affluence is the natural state.\n\n\nAs Henry David Thoreau so aptly articulated, \"Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.\" When we begin to fully experience life we discover that affluence is a birthright, not a privilege or a caste system. Without manipulation or disruptions, rivers naturally flow to the ocean, creating a plethora of life and abundance. The intrinsic code in all life is attuned for affluence: a state of thriving. This is not something that comes after we die in some distant realm of \"heaven\"; trees understand no concept of sin\u2014they are righteous in their ability to access continual giving and receiving merging into a cycle of one flow\u2014because this is their natural state. At the most core level, human beings also are coded to embody what is most natural, thriving, and life affirming: pure affluence.\nWe cannot ignore the millennia of history that has conditioned us to relate to life as anything but natural. However, we can begin returning to our connection with the flowing rhythms of nature. Unraveling and releasing the traumas of the modern world (and the history that generated it), from our nervous system can be daunting, infuriating, and confusing, until we learn to accept death, metaphorically and literally.\n\nWhat is it that has us resist the very life giving properties of nature due to our own denial of death? The irony unfolds as masterful bamboozlement! We live within shells of existence driven by fear, scarcity, greed and isolation all to \"survive.\"  Survival exists in hyper-vigilance, fighting for and defending our life in threatening situations.\n\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are in an autopilot perpetual emergency mode, preventing us from fully exhaling, releasing into and thus accessing the affluence of being natural, connected, generous and generative.",

And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",

The root of true affluence is born from witnessing and honoring the natural rhythms of the earth, then modeling and embodying these patterns into our life.\n\n\nAll wealth, power and influence created from a paradigm of commoditizing the earth or fellow living beings is the poorest expression of the human experience. Most of the \"wealth\" and \"riches\" of the world are pure illusion\u2014a fear based power-grab designed to continue enslaving humanity at large utilizing mass hypnotism, seducing rich and poor alike, to buy into this fraudulent power structure.\n\n\nEach person on this planet is responsible, at the most core level, for upholding or dismantling the old paradigm of illusory \"wealth.\" All human beings have the capacity at the most core level to access affluence as demonstrated by nature.  Our natural capacity to access this inner affluence may be extremely challenged in particular environments, for instance where war, famine, drought, corrupt government, etc are affecting the day to day conditions of reality.  However, to shift into a grounded, true and accessible model of affluence for all living beings, we must each recognize that the 1% IS the 99% and the 99% IS the 1%.  Meaning, all human beings are sovereign in recognizing their choice to uphold or dismantle the false paradigm of wealth, influence, and power in their life.\n\n\nWe are sovereign in our choice, yet integral in bringing forth a global shift as a collective. We cannot do this alone. Consider for a moment that the richest of the rich are just as impoverished as the poorest of the poor if they are locked into the paradigm of illusory wealth. Rich or poor, we are all capable of starving, feeling cut off from our innate creative and truly affluent flow.  This state is only available after we release the paradigm of illusory wealth, which is rooted in the belief that there is not enough and others must suffer for us to prosper, or that we are somehow nobly defined by our own suffering. By the same token, we are all capable of trusting our own unique creative power and dismantling where we are enslaved in order to come into right relationship with the earth, where life affirming, vibrantly thriving, overflowing affluence is the natural state.\n\n\nAs Henry David Thoreau so aptly articulated, \"Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.\" When we begin to fully experience life we discover that affluence is a birthright, not a privilege or a caste system. Without manipulation or disruptions, rivers naturally flow to the ocean, creating a plethora of life and abundance. The intrinsic code in all life is attuned for affluence: a state of thriving. This is not something that comes after we die in some distant realm of \"heaven\"; trees understand no concept of sin\u2014they are righteous in their ability to access continual giving and receiving merging into a cycle of one flow\u2014because this is their natural state. At the most core level, human beings also are coded to embody what is most natural, thriving, and life affirming: pure affluence.\nWe cannot ignore the millennia of history that has conditioned us to relate to life as anything but natural. However, we can begin returning to our connection with the flowing rhythms of nature. Unraveling and releasing the traumas of the modern world (and the history that generated it), from our nervous system can be daunting, infuriating, and confusing, until we learn to accept death, metaphorically and literally.\n\nWhat is it that has us resist the very life giving properties of nature due to our own denial of death? The irony unfolds as masterful bamboozlement! We live within shells of existence driven by fear, scarcity, greed and isolation all to \"survive.\"  Survival exists in hyper-vigilance, fighting for and defending our life in threatening situations.\n\n\nUnfortunately, most of us are in an autopilot perpetual emergency mode, preventing us from fully exhaling, releasing into and thus accessing the affluence of being natural, connected, generous and generative.",

Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

        "content": "The desert becomes a silent cat at night with a faint purr you can feel vibrating in your bones.  Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.
