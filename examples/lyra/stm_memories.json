    "content": "A dance unfolds between me and the desert, and a sacred agreement whispers every time such an exchange is enacted.  The desert agrees to display what is true to the moment and I agree to see whatever is revealed. Again as blank canvas the desert helps me step into the role of observer\u2014showing me that what I already know about myself must be perceived from another angle for me to accept the highest vibrations, the nectar from the fruit.  I surrender to the moment and let go of my stale concepts.  I've found that the more I give myself permission to grow beyond my present perceptions, the more refined my sensitivity becomes to the moment and to the essential stream of energy that can be tapped.  The desert provides permission to be sensitive to the little details: the beauty of a single cactus flower is significant\u2014and the world's turmoil is not going to be alleviated by jaded indifference. Likewise I stand to lose nothing by expanding beyond my perceptions, making love to the desert, exploring this present moment.",

    "content": "Blessed Longing by Goethe\n\n\n\"Tell no one else, only the wise\nFor the crowd will sneer at one\nI wish to praise what is fully alive,\nWhat longs to flame toward death.\n\n\nWhen the calm enfolds the love-nights\nThat created you, where you have created\nA feeling from the Unknown steals over you\nWhile the tranquil candle burns.\n\n\nYou remain no longer caught\nIn the penumbral gloom\nYou are stirred and new, you desire\nTo soar to higher creativity.\n\n\nNo distance makes you ambivalent.\nYou come on wings, enchanted\nIn such hunger for light, you\nBecome the butterfly burnt to nothing.\n\n\nSo long as you have not lived this:\nTo die is to become new,\nYou remain a gloomy guest\nOn the dark earth.\" \u2013 Goethe\n\n\n\"This poem captures the wonderful spiritual force at the heart of longing.  It suggests that true vitality is hidden within longing.  When you give in to creative passion, it will bring you to the ultimate thresholds of transfiguration and renewal. This growth causes pain, but it is a sacred pain.  It would be much more tragic to have cautiously avoided these depths and remained marooned on the shiny surfaces of the banal.\"  ~ John O'Donohue\n\n\n\"                Only someone who is ready for everything, who excludes nothing, not even the most enigmatical, will live the relation to another as something alive and will herself draw exhaustively from her own existence.\" \u2014Rainer Maria Rilke",

    "content": "Desert \u00e0 la Mode\n\nKnowing what I know now, I find it clear that my adventures with Mr. Maverick became greatly enhanced by: the desert.  Beyond enhancement, the experiences I enjoyed in the desert could even be symptoms of that particular, peculiar environment and my burning passion to explore uncharted territory.\n\n\nUntapped possibilities abound in each of us and yet we often struggle to see ourselves clearly.\n\n\nSometimes it takes seeing ourselves in the reflection of another to better see a clear picture of our own being. And in order for us to see ourselves in another, it helps to have an environment that can represent: the blank canvas.  Such a quintessential container is the desert.  Such a landscape oozes raw potential\u2014the epitome of the blank canvas, of open space\u2014no better place exists for exploring the depths of one's inner self.\n\n\n            The desert contains a vastness, a virgin canvas for me to paint my visions on.  The so-called wasteland doesn't get in the way, and what I captured there I now know was simply a reflection of my own perception being mirrored back to me.  The blank canvas effect is the ability to let personality dissolve, enabling you to be fully receptive while also being completely open for someone else to create their own vision.  When you are in the role of being a blank canvas for another, you are their sounding board, reflecting back the highest vibrations for them to receive and assimilate.  While I explored Death Valley with Mr. Maverick, the desert acted as this blank canvas for me.\n\n\n            After my initiation into Death Valley I began feeling the desert in my bones.  When I think of spiritual nourishment I think of the desert. When I think of delicious, raw water I think of the desert.  When I imagine riding waves of ecstasy and singing with a choir of stars\u2014I am transported to the desert.  That the desert provides me with nourishment, inspiration, spiritual sustenance and bliss may seem antithetical to what is typically thought of  this stark, harsh environment\u2014yet even so, the desert provided me with these things and more.",

    "content": "The desert becomes a silent cat at night with a faint purr you can feel vibrating in your bones.  Electricity conducts easily in such a place and internal firestorms consume the core of many the arid adventurer.  Here, silence can be deafening, and a practitioner's heart can become the loudest drum. Time's beat usually deafens one to eternity's rhythm\u2014but in the desert, time and infinity rub up against each other, lubricating the gears of creativity.  Dry death of the desolate tract, the desert offers the space to shed husky remnants of selves past, letting them dissolve and die off for good, creating space to metamorphose into a new self with fresh features.\n            Bharati Mukherjee tells us that \"the expatriate is the ultimate self-made artist, even the chooser of a language in which to operate...\"  When I venture into the desert I feel a bit like an expatriate\u2014and as such I choose the language through which that land speaks to me.  I am very much a part of the oceanic home I left to come to the desert, and I am alien and alone in the desiccated wasteland-- a self made artist with lingering awareness that insights and lessons are sure to come.\n            The desert speaks to me, and on my first journey with Mr. Maverick the valley of death spoke through the water as I floated on my back; through the stars as I walked late at night; through the energy that I felt coursing through my body; through the silence of the cacti and wise stones\u2014the desert spoke to me and I listened as best I could.  The desert told me to remember that each of us has the ability to be a blank canvas, each of us has an inner muse... and that each of us has the capability of unleashing greater creativity and power.                                                                                                                                                          In order to realize the highest levels of your creative flow, be willing to release fear and have utmost compassion for yourself.  Relax into your breath and see what sorts of jewels are whispered, released in this stream.  Let each perception you have of yourself bounce off of your inner blank canvas before you try and use it.  Even a truly positive perception or vision can be amplified by allowing it to pass through the void.\n            Life comes from the void, the void is never filled, and yet from its emptiness form is born.  The blank canvas effect is similar to the void in that it is a necessary aspect of the creative process, and can only be useful to those willing to explore its many dimensions.   In order for creation to come into manifestation there are some necessary pieces that must be lined up, and one such piece is the blank canvas effect.  Birthing new ideas, new creations, and new selves takes some exploration of the blank canvas, this open void space where nothing is known.  The blank canvas teaches us: that anything is possible; there is nothing that can't be dreamt; and the world is an uncut boulder that you can carve through your creative adventures and play.\n                        It's difficult to sustain life in the desert, which naturally does not make it seem very \"homey.\" And yet the desert is a home to me-- to the darker aspects of me-- a final resting place for parts of me ready to die.  And in that aspect, the desert exists as an ultimate home\u2014a place I go and never return from.  Are we born into our home or do we die into our home?  When I dance with the desert I die and am born again simultaneously, letting cycles of three wash over me in each breath: birth, life death...conception, gestation, birth.                                                                                                                     In the desert certain words resonate at a deep level beyond normal cognition, vibrating in my heart-- perhaps in my soul if I have such a thing.  One such word is the Spanish word for home or hearth: hogar.  When I taste this word I am gifted with cinnamon honey and Reiki for my stomach; my heart relaxes and I am a baby nursing on my mother's milk.  Hogar\u2014the sound vibrates at a deep level of my being, activating parts of me that can't help but sing, feeling immense gratitude for being alive.  Hogar\u2014this word makes me feel home, home in my own skin, home in the curves of this soul word.  The desert is one giant soul word, one massive hogar.  Not as comforting as mother's milk, and yet the desert is still a dependable home\u2014it will always be waiting for me, a dry embrace opening to receive and bestow initiations ready to kick my ass.",
